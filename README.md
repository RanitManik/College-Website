# About The Project

Within this repository, you'll discover a practice project focused on constructing the DCU: Dynamic Convergence University website. This endeavor encompasses both frontend and backend development, serving as a personal platform for honing comprehensive web development skills. Please note that this is not an official release but rather an educational undertaking. I developed the website primarily using HTML and CSS, but I integrated PHP to handle the backend mailing system. Hope you will like that.
